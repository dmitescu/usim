VECTOR:
-------
t_vector(long double, long double);
The first parameter x, the second is y.

OBJECT:
-------
p_object(long double, long double, long double);
The first param. is x, then y, then the mass.
Except for these three variables,
it also has 2 vectors: velocity and acceleration.


MAIN UNIVERSE STRUCTURE:
-------
sys_obj(p_object, sys_obj*, sys_obj*);

An elements must form a double linked list.
The first parameter is the object itself,
the second is the next elem., and the third is the prev element.

_tuniverse(sys_obj*, sys_obj*, unsigned int);

The universe is the linked list itself.
The first param este the starting element, and
the second param is the ending element.
The third parameter is the object count.
