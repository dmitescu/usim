# usim
A simple simulator for particles in gravitational fields.

The simulator hasn't all the features that one would desire implemented. The
simulations are decent, but not exact. For a small enough stepping time,
it works fine, but this has to be solved. For a preview of trajectories,
click [here](data/plotpreview.jpg). The trajectories should have been two
ellipses, but the particles drift in time.
